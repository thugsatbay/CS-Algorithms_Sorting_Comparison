Ass2-1SolnGraphCode.py is the code that generated the graphs for Question 1

Ass2-1SolnCustomInput.py is the code file that you can use to test against custom array size n, though the data will be generated randomly. Output is the time taken by the algorithms with respect to the question

Ass2-2Soln.py is the code for question 2. Input will ask for item array size. Then it will ask for the items. Format will be {<value>,<value>,<value>} for n=3. No spaces are allowed between values and curly brackets are included. Example {1,2,3}

Q1,Q2,Q3,Q4 are graphs for the Question 1

GurleenSinghDhodyAss2-2000063241.docx doc contains some additional info on how to run the code. It also contains answers to Q1)a,b
